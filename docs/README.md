# BMAD Studio DevOps Infrastructure

## Overview

This repository contains the DevOps infrastructure and automation framework for BMAD Studio, designed to provide robust, scalable, and secure deployment capabilities.

### Key Components

- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- **Security Automation**
- **Environment Management**
- **Monitoring and Observability**

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v18.x or later)
- **Docker**
- **Terraform** (v1.5.x or later)
- **AWS CLI**
- **Git**

### Recommended Tools

- **Snyk** for security scanning
- **Prometheus**
- **Grafana**
- **PagerDuty** (optional, for advanced monitoring)

## Getting Started

### 1. Local Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bmad-studio/devops-infrastructure.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment configurations
cp configs/environments/environment-manager.json.example configs/environments/environment-manager.json

# Configure your environment-specific settings
# Edit the JSON file with your specific configuration
```

### 2. Environment Management

We support three primary environments:

- **Development**
- **Staging**
- **Production**

Each environment has specific configurations managed through `configs/environments/environment-manager.json`.

### 3. Deployment

#### Local Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to local development environment
./bin/deploy.sh development

# Deploy to staging environment
./bin/deploy.sh staging rolling-update

# Deploy to production environment
./bin/deploy.sh production blue-green
```

### 4. Security Scanning

```bash
# Run comprehensive security scan
./configs/security/security-scan.sh
```

## CI/CD Workflow

Our GitHub Actions workflow (`/.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`) handles:

- Code Quality Checks
- Automated Testing
- Security Scanning
- Deployment to Various Environments

### Deployment Strategies

1. **Rolling Update**: Gradual infrastructure replacement
2. **Blue/Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime releases
3. **Canary Releases**: Controlled feature rollout

## Monitoring and Observability

- **Metrics**: Tracked via Prometheus
- **Visualization**: Grafana Dashboards
- **Logging**: ELK Stack Integration

### Key Metrics Monitored

- Request Latency
- Error Rates
- Resource Utilization
- Application Performance

## Security Considerations

- Automated Dependency Vulnerability Scanning
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Container Image Security Scanning
- Compliance Checks (GDPR, CCPA)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Deployment Failures**
    - Check `security-reports/` for detailed logs
    - Verify environment configurations
    - Ensure all prerequisites are met

2. **Security Scan Failures**
    - Review `security-reports/comprehensive-security-report.txt`
    - Address any highlighted vulnerabilities
    - Update dependencies if required

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Commit your changes
4. Push to the branch
5. Create a Pull Request

### Contribution Guidelines

- Follow existing code structure
- Add appropriate tests
